## Story 

"I woke up to a musky odor.." <br />
"Who am I? And where am I...?" <br />
"All I know.. I need to get out.." <br />

Tom is an attractive fella. One day.. he wakes up locked up without any memories. He needs to find clues to recover his memory and to get out of the creepy, seemingly haunted room...


## The Game

Users can move the main character, Tom, with the arrow keys. They can collect items by simply approaching it and use the items by pressing the space key. 

Tom is animated through javascript to make the game more visually appeasing.



The colors used, were mainly black, red, and yellowish toned to emotionally affect the players.

Throughout the game, there are minor jumpscares. Users must look for clues and hints to help Tom collect pieces of his memory and escape the dreaded cabin.
